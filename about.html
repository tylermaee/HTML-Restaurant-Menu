        <p>
            Originally from New York City, the Thai's family restaurant, H-Thai-Ml, has been in business since 1968. The Thai family migrated to New York from Thailand in the early 1960's. Their goal was to live the American Dream and create a better, more opportunistic life for their 3 sons. Pouring all their family savings into the restaurant, they opened their first location on the very popular corner of Park Avenue. Their food was remarkable and so was business. By age 18 all three of their sons had moved, each opening their own locations to honor and continue the family legacy. Now located in Miami, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, the family's extraordinary cusines will continue to create delicious and memorable experiences across the country, for many years to come. If you haven't yet, you must Thai it!
